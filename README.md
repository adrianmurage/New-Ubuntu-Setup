## üîß Customization

### Terminator Configuration
Located at: `~/.config/terminator/config`

### Bash Prompt
Located at: `~/.bashrc` (Git prompt function)

### Keyboard Shortcuts
Located at: `~/.inputrc` (readline configuration)

### System Shortcuts
Managed by: `gsettings` (GNOME keyboard shortcuts)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Script Won't Run
```bash
# Check if you're on Ubuntu/Debian
lsb_release -a

# Ensure you have internet connection
ping -c 3 google.com

# Try running with explicit bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrianmurage/New-Ubuntu-Setup/refs/heads/main/fresh-install.sh)
```

### Shortcut Not Working
```bash
# Reload bash configuration
source ~/.bashrc

# Start a completely new terminal session
# Or restart your desktop environment
```

### Terminator Won't Open
```bash
# Check if Terminator installed correctly
which terminator

# Try opening manually
terminator

# Check keyboard shortcut configuration
gsettings list-recursively | grep terminal
```

### Git Prompt Not Showing
```bash
# Reload readline configuration
# Start a new terminal session

# Check if function exists
type git_branch
```

## ‚ö° Performance & Resource Usage

### No Performance Impact
This script is designed to be completely safe and lightweight:

- **No memory leaks** - All operations are one-time configurations
- **No background processes** - Script completes and exits cleanly
- **No CPU overhead** - No continuous monitoring or background services
- **Minimal resource usage** - Only adds ~5-10MB for Terminator GUI (normal for any terminal)

### What Actually Runs
| Component | Memory Impact | CPU Impact | Background Processes |
|-----------|---------------|------------|---------------------|
| Default Terminal | Baseline | Baseline | 0 |
| **After Script** | +~5-10MB (GUI only) | Negligible | 0 |
| Git prompt | <1KB per prompt | <0.1% when shown | 0 |
| Shortcuts | 0KB | 0% | 0 |

### Safe Components
- **Configuration files** - Read once at startup, zero runtime overhead
- **Git prompt function** - Only executes when displaying prompt (1-2 times per command)
- **Readline shortcuts** - Built into bash, highly optimized native features
- **System settings** - Standard GNOME configurations, no additional processes

**Your system performance remains exactly the same** - just with enhanced functionality! üöÄ
